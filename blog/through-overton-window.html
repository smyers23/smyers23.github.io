									<p>Welcome to The Space Politics Duality! A blog about politics (and maybe sometimes space) from a planetary sciences graduate student.</p>
									
									<h3>Why are we here?</h3>
									
									<p>I basically have three main interests: My obsessive following of American politics, my work studying asteroids, and playing Dungeons & Dragons. Try as I might, I couldn't figure out a way to reasonably combine all three into a career path (I don't think there's a lot of demand for using space-based D&amp;D campaigns as a tool for solving political conflict, or professionally DM'ing political intrigue campaigns for astrophysicists), so I decided to settle for two interests, and start working towards a career in science policy.</p>
									<p>And that's why I made this blog. I wanted a space (Haha, get it? Space.?) where I could practice my writing, refine my political opinions, and maybe start getting my face out there.</p>
									
									<h3>What is "here"?</h3>
									
									<p>If you're here looking for new and interesting political takes that you've never seen any where else, I'm sorry to say this is not the place for you. I will be upfront that most of these posts will be about takes I've digested from the multitude of political punditry and political science podcasts I listen to. Usually it will be some amalgamation of these, Frankenstein-ed together, and shoved through the lens of my own worldview. But, there will definitely be no straight copying of other people's work (hot take alert: plagiarism is bad) and no blind regurgitation. Everything I post will be something I have thought about carefully, researched well, and (hopefully) written up in an insightful way.</p>
									<p>Despite the blog name, I actually anticipate that most of the content will be politics related, but if I get an itch to, some space related posts might find their way on here as well. We'll see. I get plenty of practice strengthening my science chops in my day-to-day, and this blog is mainly an opportunity to develop some political writing muscle.</p>
									<p>The initial goal will be to post about once a month about something relevant to the current political climate. But the cadence may change as I come to grips with the reality that I am a graduate student and my time has no value.</p>
									<p>My primary focus will be putting out writing that I feel good about, and not about amassing as big of a following as possible. To be perfectly honest, I am terrible at social media self-promotion. Seriously, I have like six Twitter followers, and I can't stand to be on Facebook or TikTok. So, if by some happenstance you have found this blog, and you are enjoying it, please share it with someone. Because I honestly don't know if I'm capable of doing that.</p>
									<p>So, whether this blog ends up being well read, or you're just here to get a writing sample because you saw my name on a job application, or if I'm just screaming into the void.</p>
									<p>Welcome!</p>
