										<h2>Blog (Deprecated)</h2>
									</header>

									<p>Here you can see the old blog posts that I wrote when I first launched this site. The intention at that point had been to write a regular blog about politics and science, however that quickly proved unsustainable. I therefore decided to deprecate the blog and replace it with a list of projects I've been involved in. If you want to see that list, please go <a href="../mainpages/projects.html">here.</a></p>
									<p><b><i>All of the views and opinions outlined in my blog are my own. They do not necessarily represent the views of my institutions (including the University of Arizona), funders (including the NSF and NCSL), collaborators, or co-authors.</i></b></p>
									<p><b><i>Furthermore, these blog posts represent my views at the time of original publication, and thus may not necessarily reflect my present views.</i></b><br>Read more <a href="../mainpages/disclaimer.html">here.</a></p>

											<h3>Another Argument Against the Filibuster</h3>
