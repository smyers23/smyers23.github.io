										<h2>Samuel A. Myers</h2>
									</header>

									

									<p>My name is Sam Myers (he/him) and I am a Ph.D. Candidate with the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. My current research involves modeling the properties of NEA's based on observations with the NASA IRTF and NEOWISE telescopes. (You can read about my <a href="../projects/model-inconsistencies.html" target="_blank">biggest project here</a>, and view all of <a href="../mainpages/research.html">my publications here</a>.) During my time as an undergraduate my research involved using Kepler data to characterize the orbits of Earth-to-Neptune sized exoplanets orbiting variable stars.</p>
									<p>I also has a strong interest in US politics and a passion for science policy. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. minor in science policy. Currently, my policy interests are focused on developing a <a href="../projects/science-policy-fellowship.html" target="_blank">Science Policy Fellowship for the state of Arizona</a>. I was also the past Student Representative to the <a href="https://dps.aas.org/" target="_blank">AAS DPS</a> and <a href="../projects/advocating-for-arecibo.html">worked with the Arecibo Science and Advocacy Partnership</a> advocating to replace the Arecibo Telescope.</p>
									<p>In my free time I enjoy playing Dungeons <span>&#38;</span> Dragons with friends, listening to podcasts, playing (and sometimes <a href="../projects/a-silly-game.html">trying my hand at making</a>) video games, cross stitching, getting outside to enjoy the desert landscapes, and spending time with his partner and two cats. Occassionally, I will even find time to pursue other hobbies, like playing piano or <a href="../projects/learning-minimalist-language.html" target="_blank">dabbling in language learning</a>.</p>
