										<h2>Samuel A. Myers</h2>

									<p>My name is Sam Myers (he/him) and I am an incoming Science Policy Fellows with the California Council on Science & Technology. I have strong interest in US politics and a passion for science policy. As part of my Ph.D., I minored in science policy and worked on a number of science policy related projects. These included work developing a <a href="../projects/science-policy-fellowship.html" target="_blank">Science Policy Fellowship for the state of Arizona</a>, serving as the Student Representative to the <a href="https://dps.aas.org/" target="_blank">AAS DPS</a>, and <a href="../projects/advocating-for-arecibo.html">working with the Arecibo Science and Advocacy Partnership</a> to advocate for replacing the Arecibo Telescope.</p>
									<p>As a scientist, I earned my Ph.D. from the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. While there, my research focused on modeling the properties of NEA's based on observations with the NASA IRTF and NEOWISE telescopes. (You can read about my <a href="../projects/model-inconsistencies.html" target="_blank">biggest project here</a>, and view all of <a href="../mainpages/publications.html">my publications here</a>.) During my time as an undergraduate my research involved using Kepler data to characterize the orbits of Earth-to-Neptune sized exoplanets orbiting variable stars.</p>	
									<p>In my free time I enjoy playing Dungeons <span>&#38;</span> Dragons with friends, listening to podcasts, playing (and sometimes <a href="../projects/a-silly-game.html">trying my hand at making</a>) video games, cross stitching, exploring local attractions, and spending time with my partner and two cats. Occassionally, I will even find time to pursue other hobbies, like playing piano or <a href="../projects/learning-minimalist-language.html" target="_blank">dabbling in language learning</a>.</p>
