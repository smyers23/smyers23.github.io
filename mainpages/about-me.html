										<h2>Samuel A. Myers</h2>
									</header>

									

									<p>Sam Myers (he/him) is a Ph.D. Candidate with the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. His current research involves modeling the properties of NEA's based on observations with the NASA IRTF and NEOWISE telescopes. You can learn more about it on the <a href="../mainpages/research.html">research page!</a> (You can also view my list of publications there.) During his time as an undergraduate his research involved using Kepler data to characterize the orbits of Earth-to-Neptune sized exoplanets orbiting variable stars.</p>
									<p>Sam also has a strong interest in US politics and a passion for science policy. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. minor in science policy. His current policy interests are focused on developing a <a href="../projects/science-policy-fellowship.html" target="_blank">Science Policy Fellowship for the state of Arizona</a>. He was also the past Student Representative to the <a href="https://dps.aas.org/" target="_blank">AAS DPS</a>, founded a science policy organization at the University of Arizona, and has <a href="../projects/advocating-for-arecibo.html">worked with the Arecibo Science and Advocacy Partnership</a> advocating to replace the Arecibo Telescope.</p>
									<p>In his free time Sam enjoys playing Dungeons <span>&#38;</span> Dragons with friends, listening to podcasts, playing (and sometimes <a href="../projects/a-silly-game.html">trying his hand at making</a>) video games, getting outside to enjoy the desert landscapes, and spending time with his partner and two cats. Occassionally, he will even find time to pursue other hobbies, like playing piano or <a href="../projects/learning-minimalist-language.html" target="_blank">dabbling in language learning</a>.</p>
