									<p>Originally, my intention for this site was to host a blog on politics and policy. However, the realities of grad school quickly set in and I have simply not had the time to update it regularly. Moving forward, my intention is to use this as a spot to post updates about my ongoing projects. I started this process in December 2023 by making a number of posts as part of a "Catch Up Tour" on what I've been up to recently. All the projects posts can be found below. <!-- Old blog posts can still be accessed <a href="../mainpages/blog.html">here.</a> --></p>
