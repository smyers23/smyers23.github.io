										<h2>Teaching about Space Policy</h2>

									<p>This last semester I fulfilled my TA requirements for my degree program. I TA'd for <a href="https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/undergraduate/courses/ptysastrgeos-214" target="_blank">PTYS 214 Life in the Cosmos</a>, essentially an introduction to astrobiology for non-STEM majors. As part of this, I was very fortunate to be able to teach a full week of the course towards the end of the semester. A big part of the course was focused on understanding how astrobiology is seen and approached through various cultural lenses, and looking at how the scientific considerations interact with the cultural considerations when it comes to extraterrestrial life. Looking at space policy was therefore a natural fit into the course themes.</p>
									<p>My first lecture focused on the history of space exploration. This started by looking at how the idea of space exploration has come up in the history of myth, religion, and storytelling across the world throughout human history. I then gave a brief overview of the history of rocketry, hitting on its origins in ancient China, its evolution under the British military, and its advances in America and Russia in the early 20th century. To wrap up this section, I then discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun" target="_blank">Wernher von Braun</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Korolev" target="_blank">Sergei Korolev</a> and the moral and political quandaries that arise with both men.</p>
									<p>I then used this discussion as a transition point to talk about the cold war space race. In so doing I highlighted the specific ways in which geopolitics influenced the development of space exploration. I then tracked this forward into the era of the space shuttle, the International Space Station, and the modern NewSpace paradigm. Finally, I wrapped up by comparing and contrasting space programs around the world and how the political structures of their governments influence the ways in which they operate.</p>
									<p>The second lecture of the week was focused on a broad overview of space policy and space law. This started with defining both science and space policy, giving examples, and tying them back to the material the students had already seen in the course. I then discussed the origins of the modern space law regime, tracing its history back to the cold war and the Antarctic Treaty System. We then discussed all the major space law treaties of the past few decades, culminating in the broad failure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Treaty" target="_blank">Moon Treaty</a>. The last part of the lecture was then spent doing an in-depth contrast of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-accords/" target="_blank">Artemis Accords</a> and the <a href="https://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465652/n6465653/c6812150/content.html" target="_blank">International Lunar Research Station</a>.</p>
									<p>I had a great time teaching these lectures and getting to introduce a whole group of students to the world of science and space policy. I'm hoping to be able to teach lectures or a course like this again at some point in the future. It was a great opportunity to hone both my teaching and communications skills, especially for a more generalized audience.</p>
